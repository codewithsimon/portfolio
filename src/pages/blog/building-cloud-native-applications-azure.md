Cloud-native development has become the standard for modern applications. Let's explore how Azure services can help build scalable and resilient systems.

## Azure Services for Cloud-Native Apps

- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**: Managed container orchestration
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute capabilities
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed database service

## Best Practices

1. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Service isolation
   - Independent deployment
   - Scalability per component

2. **DevOps Integration**
   - Automated CI/CD pipelines
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Monitoring and logging

## Real-World Examples

We'll look at how companies are implementing these practices to build robust cloud-native applications.
